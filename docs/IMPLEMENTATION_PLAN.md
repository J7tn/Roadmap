```typescript
// Optimized career node structure (minimized field names)
interface ICareerNode {
  id: string;           // 4-8 bytes
  t: string;           // title (abbreviated)
  l: CareerLevel;      // level (single char)
  s: string[];         // skills (array)
  c: string[];         // certifications
  sr: string;          // salary range
  te: string;          // time estimate
  d: string;           // description
  jt: string[];        // job titles
  r: {                 // requirements
    e: string[];       // education
